Interpretation of the resluts

The recomended system has generated a top 50 of recomended movies.

The original pick of favorite movies were the following:
- Inglourious basterds
- Pulp fiction
- Inception

Based on these favorite movies new recommended movies were generated.
For intrest on starring, title and summary csv files were created with 50 recomended movies each.

Interpeting these files with recommended movies we can see that some of them quite match. For example the recommended movies based on inglourious basterds and summary (top50recommendationsIng-bas (Summary)) which gave the following recommendations:
the-simpsons-movie,0.999999
charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory,0.999999
mission-impossible-ii
These are 3 films that i have seen and have enjoyed.


For the python recommended system i used the movie Inception.

Unfortunately getting the output file from python couldnt be completed, due to the following error:

(my_venv) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ time python /home/pi/Desktop/userreview.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
